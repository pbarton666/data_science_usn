    "You should already have Python installed on your machine. If not, no worries. You could go ahead and install a fresh Python distribution and an IDE (integrated development environment).\n",

    "This being said, there are distributions such as EnThought and Anaconda which offer integrated package management that allows easy access to extended libraries and their sometimes extensive/tedious dependencies. This is especially valuable when adding complex libraries such as NumPy, which can take hours to get right.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we’ll use the Anaconda distribution. This supports all sorts of data science and visualization packages that we’ll touch on in the advanced course, along with Python virtual environments “right out of the box.” You can install it by browsing to this sight and following\n",

    "\n",
    "https://www.anaconda.com/download/\n",
    "\n",
    "The “official” IDE for Python is called IDLE. It provides a rudimentary and very light weight debugger and file manager. IDLE works and works well, but for serious work I much prefer a more fully-functional environment such as PyCharm, WingIDE, or VSCode with the Python plug-in. If you’re accustomed to Eclipse, you could use the PyDev plug-in[1]. A light-weight debugger, Spyder, comes packaged with Anaconda. If you want to use Wing, you can download a full-on Professional version (free for 30 days)[2]. You have many options.\n",

    "Environment Variables**\n",

The response is built into the object as its **\\_\\_repr\\_\\_** method, which is executed when you type the name. When you make your own classes later on, you’ll be able to make it say something like “I’m 1, and I’m a Leo”, or anything else you like. The **int** object simply replies with a parsimonious string representation of itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "We’re pretty sure what type of object one is, but we can ask to be sure using the **type** method. In this case, we learn that it’s an **int** object (not an “integer”). In fact, **int** is the name of a built-in function and already reserved by Python. We can use it with the **isinstance** method to verify its type. This can become important – for instance, we might want to check whether an object is a number before attempting to do math with it.\n",
