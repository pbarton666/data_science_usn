This is especially valuable when adding complex libraries such as NumPy, which can take hours to get right.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we’ll use the Anaconda distribution. This supports all sorts of data science and visualization packages that we’ll touch on in the advanced course, along with Python virtual environments “right out of the box.” You can install it by browsing to this sight and following\n",

IDLE works and works well, but for serious work I much prefer a more fully-functional environment such as PyCharm, WingIDE, or VSCode with the Python plug-in. If you’re accustomed to Eclipse, you could use the PyDev plug-in[1]. A light-weight debugger, Spyder, comes packaged with Anaconda. If you want to use Wing, you can download a full-on Professional version (free for 30 days)[2]. You have many options.\n",

This means they don't process all the data at once. Instead, they proceed one step at a time through their task, then only when requested. This sort of \"lazy execution\" makes handling of even large data sets possible because only the bits of it that are being processed need be in the memory.\n",

That way there are specific points of contact that serve as gateways. As another example, methods (\"verbs\") within a class are only accessible within the context of the class.\n",

A further level of control can be exercised by employing \"getters\" and \"setters\" to control access to instance variables. Note that Python has no such requirement but sometimes it's a good idea to lock things down further.\n",

    "For this chapter, we’ll work with Python’s **sqlite3** module. It\n",
    "requires no setup, definition of an administrator, or anything else – it\n",
    "comes “batteries included”. Also, since it’s part of standard Python you\n",
    "can rely on it working on any system with Python installed. If you later\n",
    "choose to use another database – no worries. You’ll need to find and\n",
    "install a piece of middleware called a “connector” and, of course, the\n",
    "database software. What you learn here will most apply to the\n",
    "alternative tools. and your interactions with the objects it provides\n",
    "will be nearly-identical those you have with **SQLite**. Switching\n",
    "should be easy\\[48\\].\n",
    "\n",

    "Enhancements from ndarray Objects\n",
    "---------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library contains some really useful enhancements to NumPy\n",
    "arrays. The principal advances are around indexing – pandas provides\n",
    "extremely flexible means of providing **datetime** and **str** indices\n",
    "on its objects while NumPy uses only integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the implications is that the index objects have a separate\n",
    "existence from the objects they are associated with. It's possible, as\n",
    "we'll see later, to \"stretch\" an index value. For example, if we have\n",
    "weekly data originally using \"weeks\" as it's index we can reconstitute\n",
    "the index as \"days\" then reassign it. Before conducting operations on\n",
    "the array, its values will be aligned to the new index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important enhancement is that pandas objects handle missing data\n",
    "smoothly – much as SPSS or SAS does. This is important when dealing with\n",
    "\"stretched\" indices, for instance, when the now-unoccupied index points\n",
    "receive placeholder values. The nice thing is that the placeholders are\n",
    "evaluated just as you would hope when used for calculations. If you ask\n",
    "for the mean of a NumPy array with a single **numpy.NaN** value, the\n",
    "mean is reported as numpy.NaN. With pandas, the value simply drops out\n",
    "of the equation and the mean is reported as average of the remaining\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas also supports easy ways to \"bin\" values into buckets of\n",
    "user-definable ranges. This, in turn, allows creation of pivot tables\n",
    "and operations on categorized data. They also provide native support for\n",
    "database-like queries on data **Series** objects – no need to build an\n",
    "actual database or resort to \"roll your own\" means of selecting and\n",
    "organizing your information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since pandas are built on NumPy / SciPy, methods from these\n",
    "libraries can be applied to pandas data structures. Nothing has been\n",
    "left behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, all of this comes at a performance cost relative to working\n",
    "with \"straight up\" **ndarrays**. A homogenous **ndarray** is\n",
    "computationally efficient and the tools used to manipulate it are thin\n",
    "wrappers around compiled C libraries. Wickedly fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas objects are\n",
    "a bit further away from the \"bare metal\" – in particular the requirement\n",
    "to consistently realign arrays to their indices requires a\n",
    "potentially-costly computational step every time the array is loaded."

    "Our estimates seem a bit off, don't they?   The reason has a lot to do with our sampling design.   We may be sampling with too wide a range of x-values, essentially querying for \"empty\" parts of the range of y-values.  It could be many things, but that's OK.  The mean isn't the best test for a distribution without a centeral tendancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, we're seldom interested in the whole distribution.  In a complex data space, it would take a really long time to sample everything, anyway.   Usually sampling is 'adaptive'.  That means that the next sample depends on what we have learned about past samples.   We're typically interested in finding 'gradients'.  You can think of these as slopes.  If we're looking for a local maximum, we can do a 'hill climbing' exercise to take the steepest path to the top.\n",

    "TensorFlow is an open source library developed at Google to support machine learning.  Its focus is on deep neural networks.  It was developed by Geoffrey Hinton, Jeff Dean (and many others!) starting in 2009 with an initial focus on speech recognition.  It's integrated with Kubernetes via the Kubeflow application.   Version 2.0 was released in 2019, along with TensorFlow Graphics (deep learning in graphics).  It's main applications now are around image capturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google developed its 'Tensor processing unit' (TPU) - a chip designed precisely for TensorFlow.  These power Google Compute and when stacked into clusters of 64 TPUs can deliver 11.5 petaflops.   They are now available to the world on the Google Cloud Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's got a Python API (3.7+).   It also has bindings to C++, Go, Julia, and a host of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's built on numpy and uses numpy.ndarray objects as base building blocks.  It has a numpy-friendly API, so you can work with tensors pretty much the same way you'd work with numpy arrays.  These links will get you started.\n",

    "PyMC3 is used for Bayesian linear regression (and Bayesian inference, generally).   PyMC3 also contains a factor analysis module.  It specializes in simulation-based optimization of complex, high-dimension data spaces and can even handle data spaces that are defined parametrically at run-time.  PyMC3 also contains a factor analysis module\n",
    "\n",
    "With PyMC3, you can implement a Marcov chain Monte Carlo with sampling algorithms NUTS (No-U-Turn sampler) and HCM (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) that's self-tuning; that means you don't need prior knowledge of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "NUTS (No U-Turn Sampling) is a way to characterize an unknown distribution by drawing correlated samples that will converge in distribution to the unknown distribution.   It's written up by Matthew Hoffman (*J. Machine Learning Research, 2014*).   It eliminates the need to do a random walk of the distribution by calculating gradients and using them for the next target region to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a tweak to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approach that replaces random walk with simulation of Hamiltonian dynamics.  That's the bit that requires calculation of the gradient.   Gradient calculation requires that the user pick the step size ($\\epsilon$) and the number of steps (L) - and getting these right can be really tough. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hamiltonian dynamics uses an auxialiary momentum variable $r_d$ for each model variable $\\theta_d$.  It's based on partical dynamics where theta is a partical's position in D-dimensional space.   The momentum variable is the momentum in the dth dimension.  It factors in the position-dependent negative potential energy and the kinetic energy of the particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theano** is used under the hood for gradient calculation - it uses differentiation and can complile probabilistic problems to C on the fly.   Theano allows expressions to be defined as tensors, which are tightly integrated with numpy.ndarray objects.\n",
