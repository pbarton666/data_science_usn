Indentation is extremely important in Python because that's how the interpreter keeps track of how to group statements.  Unlike languages such as C and Java, it can't rely on braces for that purpose – Python uses <span class=\"underline\">only</span> indentation.  Statements at the same level of indentation are treated as a being in the same code block, and code blocks can be nested to any level.\n",

It can easily perform the same sort of analysis possible with big data analytical tools like Hadoop, but just not at the same scale. (Hadoop has its own way to manage workload and file systems – that's where its real magic lies).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a map operation is one that iterates through a bunch of objects and does the same thing to each one. A reduce operation sifts through the mapped objects and filters out the \"good stuff.\" Generally speaking, the **map** function is run once then sifted through multiple times by different reducers.\n",

The result is another iterable of only those that have been deemed **True**. The syntax is identical to that of **map**:\n",

These methods are interesting because they each take two arguments: incoming data and the name of the routine to process the data. Each returns a generator-like object. This means they don't process all the data at once. Instead, they proceed one step at a time through their task, then only when requested. This sort of \"lazy execution\" makes handling of even large data sets possible because only the bits of it that are being processed need be in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has a **reduce** method – it works pretty much like **map**, except the operations defined in the function are applied cumulatively.
